This is a sample Testify-based setup.  The framework is called (imaginatively
enough) AwesomeTestFramework - this is the same level as RSpec or minitest.
The runner is called AwesomeRunner - think of the 'rspec' command or
'autotest'.  And for flavor we've added some middleware to output valuable
information while the tests run and append some footer text at the end.

To see it in action, just run this:

  ./awesome_runner.rb awesome_tests
